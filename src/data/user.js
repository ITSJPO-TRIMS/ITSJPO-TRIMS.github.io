			"TRIMS is developed by the USDOT's Intelligent Transportion Systems Joint Program Office to provide information and resources on advanced data analytics use cases in transportation. As data analytics techniques continually advance, state and local agencies need to understand the use cases to which these techniques apply, how they can be implemented or operationalized, and how to weigh the benefits of different options. The TRIMS system provides information to help transportion practitioners make their transportation systems safer and more efficient.",
